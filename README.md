# jserver
jeson yang's server.
Although many of the code is the same as my previous project，I still knocked them out again. 
Maybe will make some bugs, I will try to do it well.

the project build by typhoon blade.(https://github.com/chen3feng/typhoon-blade)
need install protobuf(I install 3.5.1) while i once work with 2.6.1.


1、read config ,i add protobuf read mode in common pb_config.
2、objpool prepare for shm，i wiil use it later when i calc memory use
3、something with network .



If you find some bugs, please tell me, let's grow up together
